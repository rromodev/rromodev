### Master CSS Challenges

<img align="right" width="50%" src="images/Master_Challenges.png" >

A Web application where you can learn and upgrade CSS skills solving code challenges.

My job was to develop the way the challenges are validated, in this case we use CSSTree and CSSOM to generate a JSON AST from the user's css code, then we apply a set of rules using JSONata.

Also helped with the implementation of a backend with PolkaJS (ExpressJS alternative) and MongoDB Atlas to provide the challenge information
